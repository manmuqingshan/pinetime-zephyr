about.rst:9: (wirelessly)  Furthermore it can be updated wirelessly.
about.rst:21: (hypnos)  I took a long break from this project, zephyr evolved and a project for creating an open source watch, the hypnos-firmware flourished.
about.rst:23: (touchpanel)  The drivers for the heartrate sensor, touchpanel that I adapted, became obsolete.
about.rst:26: (ssd)  Recently I discovered that the standard focaltech touchscreen driver could be adapted easily so it would run on the pinetime and integrate nicely with the LVGL-gui. There were several OLED ssd1306 watches on my desk and I wondered if I could run Zephyr and LVGL (graphical stuff) on them as well. (yes, we can!)
about.rst:30: (opensource)  This gave me the idea for an opensource-watch-framework.
about.rst:30: (ds)  The framework is build around three smartwatches, the pinetime, the ds_d6 and the posix_sdl.
