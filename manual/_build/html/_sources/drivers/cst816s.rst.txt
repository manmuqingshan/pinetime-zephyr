HYNITRON CST816S 
################

Zephyr has evolved and now there is something that serve as a touchscreen device.
(KSCAN_TOUCH)

the board definition file has been adapted slightly, using the focaltech ft5336 as a touch_controller. A minor change in this driver is enough to get data from the hynitron cst816S.

The big advantage : almost standard zephyr install!
Unfortunately I cannot get the KSCAN_TOUCH working in an out-of-tree setup.

I have created the renamed ft9999 driver.



.. code-block:: console

	west build -p -b pinetime_devkit0 samples/display/lvgl



this driver does not exist, so it has been created.
Still work in progress ....





Overview
********
(this is the old way of doing things ....)

the Hynitron cst816s is a touchscreen.
Zephyr doesn't handle touchscreens yet.
In order to investigate, the touchscreen driver has been created as a sensor.
In fact it senses your finger ;)


Requirements
************


for this sensor does not exist any driver, so here's what I did to create one under zephyr

adapt CMakeLists.txt
adapt Kconfig
add yaml file

create driver
-------------

The driver reads only one position.
Multitouch is possible, but the screen is small....




see under drivers/sensor/cst816s

have a look at the pinetime.dts (under board/arm/pinetime) file:

.. code-block:: console

     &i2c1 {
             cst816s@15 {
                 	compatible = "hynitron,cst816s"; 
     	        	reg = <0x15>;
     	 	        label = "CST816S";
     	                };
            };
                                                                                                                                                                                                        



Building and Running
********************

There are two samples : 
           - samples/gui/lvtouch (graphical)
           - samples/sensor/cst816s (no graphics)




           
Todo
****

The graphical sample doesn't handle interrupts.

References

There is little available for this touchscreen.
