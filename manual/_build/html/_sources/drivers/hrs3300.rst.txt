HX HRS3300 
############


this driver does not exist, so it has been created.
Still work in progress ....


there is a sample in this repository which can be copied to the zephyr samples directory

.. code-block:: console

      west build -p -b pinetime samples/sensor/hrs3300 




Overview
********


The HX HRS3300 sensor is a heart rate sensor, it produces 2 values: ALS and HRS. Ambient LIGHT SENSOR and HEART RATE SENSOR. Which have to be processed by an algorithm. I have no knowledge of a good open source algorithm yet.



I have used the settings of an arduino port of this library.

Requirements
************


for this sensor does not exist any driver, so here's what I did to create one under zephyr

adapt CMakeLists.txt
--------------------
~/zephyrproject-2/zephyr/drivers/sensor
add_subdirectory_ifdef(CONFIG_HRS3300           hrs3300)


adapt Kconfig
--------------

~/zephyrproject-2/zephyr/drivers/sensor


add yaml file
-------------
~/zephyrproject-2/zephyr/dts/bindings/sensor
add  hx,hrs3300.yaml

edit KConfig
------------

source "drivers/sensor/hrs3300/Kconfig"

create driver
-------------
see under drivers/sensor/hrs3300

complement the pinetime.dts file with the following (under samples/sensor/bma280) 

.. code-block:: console

     &i2c1 {
             hrs3300@44 {
                 	compatible = "hx,hrs3300"; 
     	        	reg = <0x44>;
     	 	        label = "HRS3300";
     	                };
            };
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Create a file: `/dts/bindings/sensor/hx,hrs3300.yaml`.
Which contains:

::

     compatible: "hx,hrs3300"
     properties:
