# howto flash your zephyr image

Once you completed your `west build` , your image is located under the build directory

```
   $ cd ~/work/pinetime/zephyr/build/zephyr
   here you can find zephyr.bin which you can flash




I use Openocd to flash.
Just connect : telnet 127.0.0.1 4444

.. code-block:: console

    program zephyr.bin
```

# howto remove the write protection

::

    the PineTime watch is read/write protected (at least the one I got)
    executing the following : nrf52.dap apreg 1 0x0c shows 0x0

    Mind you, st-link does not allow you to execute that command, for this you will need a J-link.

    There is a workaround using the GPIO of a raspberry pi or an Orangepi. (in this case you won’t need an external programmer at all)
    (You can find an example for the orange pi in my repo :[https://github.com/najnesnaj/openocd](https://github.com/najnesnaj/openocd).)
    You have to reconfigure Openocd with the –enable-cmsis-dap option.

    Unlock the chip by executing the command:
    > nrf52.dap apreg 1 0x04 0x01
