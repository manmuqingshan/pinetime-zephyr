# Behind the scene

## Overview

Iâ€™m not a zephyr expert and am learning on the way.

In this chapter I let you glimpse behind the scene. (and notice all the struggle)

In case of the accel sensor, I used the bosch bma280 as a template.

In case of the touchscreen, I soon ran into trouble.
So I tried splitting a complex problem into simpler ones.

This allowed me to detect problems easier.

The created samples might be of some use, if you run into trouble or if you want to extend the functionality.
