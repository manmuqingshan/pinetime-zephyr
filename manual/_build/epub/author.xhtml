<h1>Author</h1>
<p>Some 20 years ago I attended a course on how to brew beer.
Real beer, starting with barley, wheat, yeast, brew kettles â€¦</p>
<p>I bought some brewing equipment and started brewing my own beer.
Apart from a stupid idea, (why brew beer in a country that has plenty of breweries), I soon found out that brewing is labor intensive.</p>
<p>Instead of quitting right away (the most sensible thing to do), I tried to reduce the effort.
I switched from a gas heated kettle to an electric one.</p>
<p>The next step was to control the temperature.
I got an arduino and a temp-sensor.
This got me interested in microcontrollers.</p>
<p>It appealed to my childish nature, that I could get quick results with little coding.
Blinking a led, really lightens up my day!
And a beer of course.</p>
