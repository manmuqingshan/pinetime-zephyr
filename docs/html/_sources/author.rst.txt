Some 20 years ago I attended a course on how to brew beer.
Real beer, starting with barley, wheat, yeast, brew kettles ...

I bought some brewing equipment and started brewing my own beer.
Apart from a stupid idea, (why brew beer in a country that has plenty of breweries), I soon found out that brewing is labor intensive.


Instead of quitting right away (the most sensible thing to do), I tried to reduce the effort. 
I switched from a gas heated kettle to an electric one.


The next step was to control the temperature.
I got an arduino and a temp-sensor.
This got me interested in microcontrollers.


It appealed to my childish nature, that I could get quick results with little coding.
Blinking a led, really lightens up my day!
And a beer of course.

        Guess, even for a technically skilled audiance, story-telling,  renders a manual less boring ...
